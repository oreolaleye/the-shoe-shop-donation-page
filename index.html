						<h1>Help Fund Our New Space</h1>
						<div>
							<p>The Shoe Shop sells beautiful, high-quality women’s shoes from the UK & US. We deliver free to every part of Nigeria.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our space has become too small for the shoes, for us and for you.
							</p>
							<p>
								We need your support to finance the construction of our new store.

							In 2013, I tried to buy shoes for myself. After visiting several stores, I found that most of the available options were too expensive, too old, inauthentic or had been in stock for too long. I realized that if I had this need, a lot of other women probably did too.
							<br /> <br />
							And I wasn’t wrong — over the past 8 years, thousands of women from all over Nigeria (and the world) have bought shoes from us online and in-store. And we are forever grateful for this.
						</p>

						<p>
							A year ago, we realized that we need a larger store that could accommodate the increasing range of designs we’d like to make available to our clients, and so we made arrangements to procure one. Long story short, it’s HUGE, it’s permanent and we’ll never have to pay rent again. The video above gives you a better idea of the size.
							<br /> <br />
							But the state of this space is not currently useable, we have to finish it to make it habitable for the shop and the shoes. We’ve explored several quotes and the most modest one came to ₦35,000,000 ( see below for a breakdown).
						</p>
						
						</div>
				</article>
				<article id="support" class="hide">
					<div>
						<img class="media img-left" src="img/shoe.jpg" alt="" />
						<p>
							We had 2 options. 
							<br /> <br />
							Option 1 was to take the money from the shoes and use it to complete the space. Not only would that take several years, we also face the problem of not having space to keep our increasing number of shoes, and it would also affect the number of shoes you are able to choose from. Remember that the US dollar goes up every other week. The number of shoes that we were able to buy when the dollar was ₦360 is much less than we are able to buy today with the dollar at ₦485. If we chose this method, our meagre funds would, rather than go towards bringing more shoes, be expended on the building project. 
							<br /> <br />
							Option 2 was this crowdfunding. I realized that everything this business has been able to do over the past 8 years was done through your support. I moved from my parents’ house to our first store; from just me for the first 5 years to 12+ employees. 
							<br /> <br />
							Then we found a way to subsidize delivery charges so much that we decided to bear the costs on your behalf so all you have to worry about is the cost of the shoes. All of this has been because you have made it possible. That’s why I came back to you.

					<h2>What your donation would help us achieve</h2>
					<img src="" alt="" />
					<p>
						Our goal is to get the space to be useable and comfortable for you— to look like this. We’ll have over 2000 pairs of shoes available for purchase at every point.
						<br />
						Below is a breakdown of the costs:

					</div>
					<p>
						This quote does not include workmanship for the labourers, doors, cameras, Central AC System , ceiling work and the WC System for the toilets. It also excludes several other costs like computers, staff sitting, staff lounge, and so on. These are all costs that we will bear.
